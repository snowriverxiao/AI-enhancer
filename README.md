# AI-enhancer
## A deep learning algorithm to predict enhancer regions from DNA sequence <h2> 
### Workflow <h3> 
![GitHub Logo](/images/model_plot.png)

# Prerequisites
  Users need to install python (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and some python packages:
   * [tensorflow]
   * [keras]
   * [numpy]
   * [pandas]
   * [Bio]
   * [scikit-learn]
   
# Data preparation and Model training
```bash
 1. Add sequence fasta files into folder "Data".  
 2. Run python script “sequenceEncode.py” to train and validate the AI-enhancer model. The results will be stored in folder "EncodeData". 
    python sequenceEncode.py humanEHC_VISTA-ext_posSet.fa humanEHC_VISTA-ext_negSet.fa humanEHC_VISTA-ext
 3. Run python script "model_building.py". The well-trained AI-enhancer model will be stored in the folder "ModelOutput" for follow-up enhancer prediction. 
    python multipleModel_AttenComb.py filelist_VISTA VISTA
 4. AI-enhancer will provide enhancer prediction with probability scores to rank all candidate enhancers, which will facilitate the follow-up experimental validation (e.g. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of predicted enhancers).
